FIRMWARE - Mytek Digital Stereo192-DSD DAC using the USB2 interface
Last updated: 07-dec-2012 Jurgen Kramer

When using the USB2 interface on the Mytek three pieces of firmware need to be 
uploaded to the device. These can be extracted from the Winwows driver.

- Download the Windows firmware

go to the Mytek Digital website: http://www.mytekdigital.com/
Click 'High Fidelity'
Scroll to 'Support & Downloads' and click on 'Latest Drivers (OS X and Windows)'

This will download the file 'Mytek_Stereo192_DSD_DAC_drivers.zip'.
Extract using unzip and locate the file 'stereo192-dsd_dac_usb_driver_win_v1.33.10.zip'.
Unzip it and locate the following files:

- mytekl2.ihx
- mytekcf.bin
- mytekap.ihx

These files need to be copied to the firmware directory on your system into a
newly created directory 'mytek'. On most system the firmware directory is:

/lib/firmware

So the firmware files need to go to:

/lib/firmware/mytek

The driver checks the firmware version and currently only supports Windows 
firmware mentioned above.

To verify, the sha1sums of the supported firmware files are:
